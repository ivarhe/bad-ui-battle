# Bad UI Battle - Worst Ticket Flow Progress

## Goal
Create the worst possible UX flow for showing a ticket to an inspector, simulating the Ruter → Retur rebrand.

## Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Opening old Ruter
- [x] Show message that this is the old app
- [x] Inform user about new "Retur" app
- [x] Add redirect/button to download new app
- [x] Added annoying blinking effects and delays

### ✅ Step 2: Download new Retur
- [x] Simulate app store download flow
- [x] Add fake loading/progress indicator with fake errors
- [x] Transition to new app
- [x] Made download slow and annoying

### ✅ Step 3: Opening new "Ruter" Retur
- [x] Initial screen of new app
- [x] Show Retur branding
- [x] Added unnecessary loading delay

### ✅ Step 4: Reauthentication Required
- [x] Show security policy message
- [x] Display Digipost view with code
- [x] Prevent pasting (disable paste functionality)
- [x] Made code hard to read with rotation and random sizing

### ✅ Step 5: Human Verification
- [x] Full screen grass background
- [x] Cricket appears briefly and randomly (0.8-1.2 seconds)
- [x] User must click 3 crickets quickly
- [x] Made it frustratingly difficult with timer

### ✅ Step 6: Personal Information Verification
- [x] Ask for birthday
- [x] Mention can't store info longer than 2 hours
- [x] Created horrible input flow (accepts any valid birthday - teammate will replace with custom component)

### ✅ Step 7: Show Ticket
- [x] Display ticket finally
- [x] Made it hard to read with rotation and expiration
- [x] Ticket expires in 30 seconds for extra frustration

## Notes
- Each step should be intentionally frustrating
- Add delays, confusing UI, and poor feedback
- Make navigation between steps unclear
